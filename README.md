# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of the analysis was to identify and visualize how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals using the Kickstarter dataset.

## Analysis and Challenges
The analysis was performed using the kickstarter dataset.  To identify how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch date, a pivot table was created and the "Parent_Category" was filtered to only show "Theater".  To identify how different campaigns fared in relation to their fundings goals, the count_ifs formula in excel was used.  There were no challenges in performing the analysis but in the future, potential challenges might arise if formulas were incorrectly applied.

## Results

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
May (highest) and June had the highest number of total campaigns.  December (fewest) and November had the fewest. Though we weren't asked to identify the percentage of successful campaigns in a given month, it appears that May and June also had the highest percentage of successful campaigns. They also had the highest absolute number of successful campaigns.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
It appears that more modest goals lead to a greater percentage of successful campaigns in the theater subcategory.  For play campaigns with a goal of less than $1,000 for example, 76% were successful, the highest percentage of any "goal" category.   

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Given the smaller sample sizes for campaigns that have goals above $15k where the subcategory is plays, it' difficult to draw too strong a conclusion regarding campaigns with larger sized goals, although it does appear that there is a positive correlation between goal size and success rate.  The chart could be enhanced by providing some indication of sample size for each category.
